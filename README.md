# Emergency-Brake-Assist-System

## Overview
In the automotive industry one of the growing causes for
accidents is when drivers accidentally press the gas pedal
instead of the brake pedal. With the rapid advance of machine
learning and computer vision algorithms EBAS uses RADAR sensors to provide
a very accurate estimation of the distance between your front
bumper and the car in front. Using MATLAB I have designed and implemented the EBAS system.
